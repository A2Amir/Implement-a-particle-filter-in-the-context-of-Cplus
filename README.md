# Particle Filters in C++

You know what particle filter is and how it works. In this lesson, you learn some important implementation details. Afterwards you will be able to understand how to implement a particle filter in the context of C++.

## Pseudocode

To implement a particle filter we start with the flowchart (see below), which represent the steps of the particle filter algorithm as well as its inputs.
